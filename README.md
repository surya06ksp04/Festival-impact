# Festival Economy Impact Analysis

This project estimates the economic uplift caused by festivals (Diwali, Christmas, Eid)
using retail sales, flight bookings and hotel price datasets.

## What this repository contains
- `data/sample_data.csv`: synthetic sample data (generated by `generate_sample_data.py`)
- `scripts/generate_sample_data.py`: generator for synthetic test data
- `scripts/festival_analysis.py`: main analysis pipeline (cleaning, event study, forecasting, prediction)
- `outputs/`: where charts & CSV outputs are written

## How to run
1. Create a virtualenv and install requirements:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. (Optional) Generate sample data:
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py

3. Run analysis:
python scripts/festival_analysis.py

## Notes & next steps
- Replace `data/sample_data.csv` with your real dataset (same column names).
- Improve uplift estimation using a formal Difference-in-Differences design:
- Add region-level controls, time fixed effects, and pre-trend checks.
- For forecasting use more advanced time-series cross-sectional models or Prophet.
- To predict best festival next year, add macro features, Google Trends, airfare promotions, and policy info.

## Framework & Model
Language:  
- Python

Frameworks/Libraries Used:
- pandas for data handling
- numpy for calculations
- scikit-learn for prediction modeling
- matplotlib/seaborn for visualization

Model Used:
- Linear Regression (from sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)

Evaluation Metric: 
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## Model Performance
Test RMSE: 120.38

RMSE measures the typical error between predicted uplift and actual uplift.

Since the average uplift values are in the 300–400 range, an RMSE of 120 means the model is moderately accurate — good enough for trend predictions, but not for fine-grained forecasting.

## Event-Window Uplift (Observed Data)
The raw festival vs. non-festival uplift % by region:

Highest observed uplift:
- West, Diwali → +25.79% vs baseline sales
- East, Diwali → +24.86%
- North, Diwali → +25.13%

Lowest uplift: 
- Around +14% for Eid in various regions

## Insights
- Diwali is the most economically impactful festival across all regions, with retail uplift often exceeding +25% over non-festival periods.
- Christmas is consistently second, with strong travel & shopping spikes.
- Eid also has notable impact, but slightly lower compared to the other two festivals in retail terms.
- The prediction model aligns with the observed trends, indicating good generalization despite moderate RMSE.
